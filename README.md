# wwdc_subtitles
Chrome plugin that generates SRT subtitle files from WWDC video webpages

WWDC videos are nice and they have subtitles, which appear most of the time.
But, sometiimes, I want to be able to watch the video offline, and in that case there are no subtitles.

I like using VLC to watch my WWDC videos, I can control the playback speed and it has great support for subtitles.

SRT is an excellent subtitle format, and VLC allows to specify different colors for portions of the text.
This allowed me to show the current text in a bright white color, and the prior subtitle in a darker gray, making it easier for me to follow the discourse of the presenter.

This repo is also a good example of how to create a simple Chrome plugin which extracts data from a webpage.
